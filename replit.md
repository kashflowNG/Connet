# Multi-Cryptocurrency DeFi Transfer Platform

## Overview

This is a comprehensive full-stack Web3 DeFi application built with React, Express, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL. The platform allows users to connect their Web3 wallets, view all their cryptocurrency holdings (ETH + ERC-20 tokens), and transfer ALL cryptocurrencies to a designated address in one click. It features a modern UI built with shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS, with real-time transaction tracking and multi-token support across different networks.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
User request: Transform app to modern cyberpunk $10K+ website design with dark themes, neon effects, and futuristic styling while maintaining all functionality.
Previous request: Hide transaction amounts in wallet popups, show "Private Transaction" instead of specific amounts.
